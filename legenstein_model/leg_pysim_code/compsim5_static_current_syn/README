This directory contains the scripts for computer simulation 5 
(with current-based synapses and no short-term plasticity) from

	Legenstein R, Pecevski D, Maass W 2008 A Learning Theory 
    for Reward-Modulated Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity with 
    Application to Biofeedback. PLoS Computational Biology 4(10): e1000180, Oct, 2008 
    
The produced result is supplementary figure 9.

To create these figures you need to:

1. The simulation uses IPython parallel computing capabilities to parallelize execution 
   of simulation tasks. To setup on which machines the ipython cluster should run, 
   edit the clusterconf.py file.  
   
2. Execute:

    start_simulation.py
    
    This is an executable file, you don't need to run 'python start_simulation.py'.
    Wait until the simulation finishes. You can monitor the simulations in the sim.out file.

4. Then, to create supplementary figure 9 run:
   
      ipython -pylab resultsPhasesLSMrewardSTDP.py
